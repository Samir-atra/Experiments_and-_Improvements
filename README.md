# Experiments_and_Improvements
this repository was created to include programs that serve certain applications and built with libraries, 
for the purpose of learning how the programs function and how to use the libraries

This repository contains two directories:
- GAN: two Generative Adversarial Networks one of them was built and optimized to generate images of cars.

and the other network was optimized to generate images of tree leaves and it did show beginner results, without further improvements.

-JAX: the directory contains some programs built using the JAX library, to learn how to use the libary and debug the error relevant to using it.

and that is because the libary has a superior speed and performance to to NumPy but it has similar functions and classes. 
and building these programs came after studying a course about the library on LinkedIn learning.
