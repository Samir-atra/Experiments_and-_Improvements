# Machine-Learning

This repository contains multiple machine learning application developed for learning

datasets:
    
    First: is the brain tumor from cancer detector.
    
    Second: is stanford car dataset. http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html
    
    Third: is shoes dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifeanyinneji/nike-adidas-shoes-for-image-classification-dataset?resource=download  and from  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noobyogi0100/shoe-dataset



working to implement this paper:    http://people.tamu.edu/~sji/classes/LR.pdf      and looks
like it's not thorough and good enough

to be continued after getting better understanding to optimization techniques
