was working on CarGAN and thought of creating another one that works on a simpler dataset, smaller and less complex images.

"Leafish" is the best result I got so far and it was after 80 epoch on the setup in the initial commit, training for more epoch could have resulted better leaf but it has long way to reallity.

and working with the help of tutorials, blogs and articles no previous GAN learning so the changes might be not on spot.
